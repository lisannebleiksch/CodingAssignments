# Assignment 1 – Hello World

Welcome to your first programming assignment.

The goal of this assignment is not to be difficult.  
The goal is to **experience what programming actually feels like**:
- installing tools
- opening code
- running a program
- seeing output

If you like this process, that is a good signal. If you hate it, that is also useful information.

## 1. Choose an editor (interpreter environment)

You need a place to **write and run code**. These are good options:

### Recommended (beginner-friendly)
- **VS Code (Visual Studio Code)**  
  Free, widely used, works on Windows / Mac / Linux  
  Install with warp 

you can have it integrated with AI as well via github copilot

### Alternatives
- PyCharm (more heavy, more opinionated)
- Cursor (AI-first, but can be distracting for beginners)



After installing VS Code:
- Open it once
- Install the **Python extension** when VS Code asks for it

---


## 2. Connect VS Code to GitHub
This can also all be done with the source control GUI

Inside VS Code:

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`
2. Type `GitHub: Sign in`
3. Follow the browser steps

This only needs to be done once.

## 3. Clone the repository locally

1. In VS Code press `Ctrl + Shift + P`
2. Type `Git: Clone`
3. Paste the repository URL
4. Choose a folder
5. Open the folder when asked

## 4. Assignment goal – Hello World

Make the program print:

```text
Hello, world!
```

---

## 5. Running the program

### Terminal

```bash
python main.py
```
